The present invention relates to the field of network analysis, and more particularly to a method and system for analyzing network data.
Network analysis is a field of study that focuses on the structure and behavior of networks. Networks are collections of nodes that are connected by links. Nodes are the individual elements of a network, such as people, organizations, web pages, computers, sensors, and so on. Links represent the connections between nodes. For example, a network of people might be represented by a graph in which each person is a node and a link connects two people if they know each other.
Network analysis is used to study a wide variety of networks, including social networks, communication networks, transportation networks, and biological networks. Network analysis can be used to understand the structure of a network, the behavior of the nodes in the network, and the flow of information or other resources through the network.
