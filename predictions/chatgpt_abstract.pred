The air is then returned to the exterior. The method may include exhausting the air to the rear of the washer, passing the air without adding heat, rotating the drum during the ventilation process, and drying surfaces within the tub."
"A three-ply sanitary tissue product is disclosed, comprising a plurality of pulp fibers. The product exhibits specific characteristics, including a compressibility greater than 34 mils/(log(g/in2)), a plate stiffness of less than 3.75 N*mm, and a slip stick coefficient of friction of less than 500 (COF*10000). The product can be made with different types of pulp fibers and can include various ply structures, such as embossed, 3D patterned, through-air-dried, fabric creped, belt creped, or conventional wet-pressed. Another embodiment of the invention is a creped three-ply sanitary tissue product comprising at least one through-air-dried fibrous structure ply, exhibiting similar characteristics."
"A sized fiber is disclosed, which comprises a fiber coated with amorphous polyetherketoneketone. The coating, which makes up about 0.01 to about 10% by weight of the sized fiber, has a thickness ranging from about 1 micron to about 50 microns."
"A knit sock is disclosed, comprising a foot portion with a heel and a targeted compression zone. The compression zone includes axially extending compression ridges that are spaced apart and have different termination points. The compression force applied by the sock within the targeted compression zone is greater than in directly adjacent areas. The compression zone may include elastic yarns or individual uncut pattern yarns. The shape of the compression zone is generally semi-circular, with one side being arcuate and the other side being linear. The compression ridges taper in length from the linear side to the arcuate side. The compression zone has increased density and reduced stretchability compared to adjacent areas of the sock."
"An apparatus for controlling the dwell timing of a transfer arm in a rotary braiding machine is disclosed. The apparatus includes a crank, a cam, and an actuator arm mechanism. The actuator arm mechanism comprises a first actuator arm and a second actuator arm, both having adjustable ends with threaded openings. An actuating arm adjuster is connected to the adjustable ends of the first and second actuator arms to control the length of the actuator arm mechanism. The actuating arm adjuster includes threaded ends that mesh with the threaded openings of the actuator arms and a central portion for turning the adjuster with a tool. The dwell timing of the actuator arm mechanism can be adjusted by turning the actuating arm adjuster. A method of adjusting the dwell timing using the apparatus is also provided."
"A method for decortication, degumming, decontamination, whitening, and softening of plant biomass is disclosed. The method involves submerging the plant biomass material in an aqueous-based decortication solution containing exogenous catalysts, heating the solution to a predetermined temperature range for a predetermined incubation period, and introducing an alkaline wash solution or alkaline powder to promote the desired effects on the plant biomass material. The catalysts facilitate the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS), which interact with the biomass material to achieve the desired decortication, degumming, decontamination, whitening, and softening. The method does not require mechanical pre-treatment of the biomass material."
"A sewing data generating apparatus is disclosed, which includes an image acquisition unit that acquires an image of an embroidery frame and a sewing target mounted on a base cloth, an acquired image analyzing unit that analyzes the acquired image based on information about the embroidery frame, and an outline data generating unit that generates outline data for the sewing target. The apparatus can also include a sewing data generating unit, an embroidery frame information acquisition unit, a transmission unit, a display control unit, an operation guidance unit, and a control unit. The apparatus can be part of a sewing system that includes a sewing machine."
"The present invention relates to a cellulose fiber comprising a matrix phase and needle-shaped phases oriented along an axial direction. The matrix phase has a cellulose II crystal structure, while the needle-shaped phases have a cellulose I crystal structure. The cellulose fiber has an average length of 2 μm to 4 μm and an average diameter of 3 nm to 100 nm. The content of the needle-shaped phases in the matrix phase is 2 parts by mass to 25 parts by mass per 100 parts by mass of the matrix phase. Additionally, a composite material is disclosed, which includes the cellulose fiber secured to a base material using a binder. Furthermore, a method of producing the cellulose fiber is provided, involving the preparation of a solution with dispersed needle-shaped phases and extrusion through a spinning nozzle followed by coagulation."
"A two-ply, through air dried tissue is disclosed, with an outer surface that has specific surface characteristics. The outer surface has an Average Peak to Valley Waviness of 140 microns or less and/or an Average Primary Amplitude of 50 microns or less. The tissue may also have additional characteristics such as Waviness Uniformity, Amplitude Uniformity, bulk softness, lint value, softness, and caliper."
"A method for improving the dry strength and drainage of paper or paperboard by adding a graft copolymer composition to the paper or paperboard furnish. The graft copolymer composition includes a vinyl monomer and a functionalized vinylamine-containing base polymer. The functionalized vinylamine-containing base polymer contains randomly distributed repeating monomer units and is reacted with an α,β-unsaturated alkyl carbonyl compound through Michael addition by vinylamine in the polymer. The method also includes the use of additives, such as an aqueous dispersion of a cationic amide-containing polymer, in combination with the composition. The resulting paper or paperboard exhibits improved dry strength and drainage properties."
"An industrial washer is disclosed that permits operation only when secured. The washer includes a body with an inner compartment and a loading opening, a washer door that moves between open and closed positions, and a locking bracket that can be secured against a locking surface when the washer door is closed. A sensor is positioned on the body, and a sensor target is positioned on the washer door so that it is only detectable by the sensor when the door is closed. The washer may also include a controller that permits operation only if the sensor detects the sensor target."
