" 4. An article made from said multi-plain fibrous web material having at least one layer that is formed by wet laid or dry creped through an aqueous suspension containing cellulosic fiber materials in combination with superabsorbent polymer particles dispersed therein;
wherein the absorbent capacity of each sheet has been increased substantially over sheets prepared without such polymeric particle addition but which have not had any prior treatment applied thereto. <|dep|> 5. An article produced using the multi-layer nonwoven substrate described in either claims 1, 2, 4, or 6–8 characterized in that it comprises:
a first outer ply comprised primarily of synthetic staple fibers bonded together via heat bonds between thermoplastic binder filaments within the plies while being free of adhesive bonding for improved strength properties compared to second inner layers thereof composed solely of nonbonded bicomponent filament polymers including spunbond polypropylene fabric reinforcing scrims disposed therebetween so as to be sandwiched directly beneath the top surface of the bottom layer of the composite structure when they are brought into contact therewith during use; and
the third outer ply also comprised predominantly synthetic staple fibers bonded together via thermal bondings among thermoplastic binder filaments within the plies while being free of adhesive bonding for better resistance against water penetration thereby resulting in higher liquid absorption rates per unit weight basis under load conditions compared to fourth outer plies consisting exclusively of spunlaced polyester fabrics reinforced only with thermally bonded bicomponent filament polymers alone."
 2. The size-fiber according claim 1 wherein the coated fibers have an average diameter from about 5 μm upto 100 mm.
" 3. The knit sock according to claims 1 or 2, further including an outer layer having substantially uniform thickness throughout its length except for regions where it has been compressed during knitting as defined herein above."
" 3. A method, as claimed in claims 1 or 2 further including providing at least one sensor on each side of said mandrel assembly for sensing when it has reached its desired position during operation of said spinning device."
" 4. The method according to any one of claims 1, 2 and 3 further including adding at least one additional catalyst selected from alkali metal salts, ammonium salt, organic acids, inorganic acid salts, chelates thereof, combinations thereof, and mixtures thereof prior to said submersion step."
" 4. An embroidery machine having at least one needle which is driven in accordance with stitch data including embroidery pattern data obtained from electronic control signals transmitted through communication lines or wireless signal waves received via antenna units, wherein said needles are controlled so as not to be moved relative to each other during stitches performed using the same thread but moving together after performing stitches different threads,
wherein said embroidery frame includes two kinds of frames differing in size such that they have sizes larger than those of another kind of frame when viewed along a direction perpendicular to both longitudinal directions thereof, respectively, and has a shape corresponding to either one of these two types of frames."
" 5. An organic solvent solution containing at least one compound selected from compounds represented by general formula (1) or salts thereof as solute
(i):
wherein R represents hydrogen atom or methyl group; X represents —O— or —S—; Y represents oxygen atom or sulfur atom; m represents integer ranging from 0 to 10; n represents number of repeating units derived from any monomer constituting said polymer being not more than 1000; p represents number of repeating groups within each unit consisting of two kinds of monomers forming said polymers differing with respect to their order of polymerization; r represents number of repetition of said unit having different sequence for all said plural types of monomers; s represents sum total of numbers of occurrence of substituents on carbon atoms contained in respective molecules included in said polymer; t represents number of occurrences of substituent on carbon atoms contained in said molecule; u represents number of times of occurrence of substitution reaction on carbon atoms contained in said polymer; v represents number of repetitions of said substitution reaction; w represents weight percentage occupied by substituted carbons contained in said polymer; x represents molecular chain length between main chains possessed by individual ones among those formed through copolymerization reactions using said monomers; y represents molar ratio of said monomers used for formation of said copolymer; z represents number of repeat of addition reaction per mole of said copolymer; k represents degree of cross linking of said copolymers; l represents number of moles of said copolymer; and M represents mass of said substance)."
