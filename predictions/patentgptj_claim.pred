The present invention provides several advantages over prior devices. For example, because the components used to create the resistance to relative movements may all have similar characteristics, they need no calibration procedures before being assembled into their final form. This reduces costs associated therewith since fewer parts than would otherwise exist were there been required to calibrate them during assembly. Also, if desired, different types of springs could easily be selected depending upon how much weight was placed thereon. In addition, this allows more flexibility in choosing spring materials due to its ability to withstand high loads without failure. Finally, the design also permits easy replacement of failed elements thereby reducing maintenance requirements. As noted earlier, many conventional systems require some type of adjustment after installation once installed. However, the adjustable nature of the present invention makes it possible to adjust the position of various portions thereof simply by moving certain ones of the components along the length of the track. Thus, even though numerous embodiments of the present inventions disclosed herein include identical structures having substantially equivalent properties, nevertheless differing structure modifications thereto remain nonetheless encompassed by the scope hereof.<|end_of_description|><|endoftext|><|endoftext|><|backward_claim_start|>comprising: apparatus forming image color tandem A 8.
