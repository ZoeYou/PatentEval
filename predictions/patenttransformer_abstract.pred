"Disclosed is a knit footwear, particularly an upper with a soft heel, which comprises a foot portion and a compression zone which may be in the form of a separate body yarn, preferably a weft knit sole. The sole comprises a plurality of compression ridges which are spaced-apart from each other and extend axially from a first end of the compression zone proximate the heel to a second end. The ridge has a different termination point with the compression zone. For some embodiment, the sole may have axially extending compression ridges which comprise a plurality of axially extending compression ridges in alternating sequences arranged substantially axially along the sole. The ridge may have a substantially circular form or semi-circular form."
"A method for adjusting the length of an extensible arm mechanism of a rotary braiding machine comprises the steps of providing a first adjustment arm having an adjustment end and a threaded opening in the adjustment end, a third adjustment arm having an adjustment end and a threaded opening, a fourth adjustment arm having an adjustment end and a threaded opening, a first actuator arm having a crank end and a second adjustment arm having a cam end, the first and third arms being attached to a crank and the second and fourth arms being attached to a cam. The threads of the first and second arms are configured to rotate in a first direction. The threads of the third and fourth arms are configured to rotate in a second opposite direction. The length of the first arm is determined by rotating the crank until the adjustment end of the first arm is aligned with the adjustment end of the second arm. The threads of the first and third arms are then threaded onto the threaded opening of the first arm. The length of the second arm is determined by rotating the cam until the adjustment end of to the third arm is aligned with the adjustment end of the fourth arm. The threads of the second and fourth arms are then threaded onto the threaded opening of the second arm, thereby allowing the lengths of the adjustment arms to be adjusted independently."
"Methods for decortication, degumming, decontamination, whitening, and softening of plant biomass materials are provided. The methods include: a) providing plant biomass material; b) heating the plant biomass material to a pre-determined temperature range for a pre-determined incubation period; and c) introducing an alkaline wash solution or alkaline powder into the decortication solution in the pre-determined incubation period to promote decortication, degumming, decontamination, and/or whitening of the plant biomass material."
The sewing data generating apparatus includes: an image acquisition unit that acquires an image of an embroidery frame and a sewing target of the frame; an acquired image analyzing unit that analyzes the image based on a correspondence between information with respect to the frame and information with respect to the image of the frame acquired by the image acquisition unit; and an outline data generating unit that generates a sewing data for the frame based on the image analyzed by the acquired image analyzing unit.
"Disclosed herein is a composite material comprising: a base material; a cellulose fiber; and a binder. The cellulose fiber is dispersed in a matrix phase comprising a cellulose II crystal structure. The cellulose fiber at least comprises an average length of needle-shaped phases and an average diameter of needle-shaped phases. In this composite material, an average length of the needle-shaped phases and an average diameter of the needle-shaped phases are determined such that the composite material exhibits a desired physical property. The method of producing the composite material is characterized by an amount of the cellulose fiber and the amount of the base material such that the composite material exhibits a desired physical property. Therefore, a composite material including a cellulose fiber with a desired physical property is formed."
"A process for making a two-ply through air dried tissue wherein at least one of an frequent edge length, a low through air weight, a high air weight, an improved air weight, or a high air weight are controlled to produce a two ply, through air dried tissue wherein a high air weight is controlled within a predetermined range and wherein the air weight of the through air dried tissue is controlled within a predetermined range. The process comprising the steps of forming a tissue web and controlling the amount of one or more of anwise, crosswise, or a combination thereof."
