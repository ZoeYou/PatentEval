The titanium (Ti) biomedical implant of claim 8, wherein fibronectin (FN) is coupled with tresyl chloride-activated Ti.",The present invention implements a set of grooves/ridges created on Ti at the circumferential direction to increase surface area of implant in contact with bone. These grooves/ridges protect nanofiber matrix (NFM) made with Polycaprolactone (PCL) electrospun nanofiber (ENF) and collagen at the groove from physiological loading. Controlled fabrication of a ridge made with titanium nitride (TiN) around the circumference of Ti is provided using a plasma nitride deposition technique. PCL ENF may be deposited along the sub-micrometer grooves using the electrospin setup disclosed. The method provides for fabrication of microgroove on Ti using machining or TiN deposition and filling the microgrooves with the NFM. This method has proven through experimentation to be successful in increasing in vivo mechanical stability and promoting osseointegration on Ti implants. The immobilization of MgO NP and FN with the PCL-CG NFM on microgrooved Ti as provided in the invention optimizes biological performances of Ti.
