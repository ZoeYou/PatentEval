    "output1": "A method for reading barcodes and a system for reading barcode for use with the method. A method for processing barcode data includes reading a barcode with a barcode scanner, the barcode containing information, the scanner being capable of scanning the barcode. The barcode includes a barcode tag and an indication of a function to be carried out with the information contained in the barcode. A system for processing barcode data includes a barcode scanner in electrical communication with a host computer. The host computer includes a microprocessor and a memory. The memory stores program instructions for causing the microprocessor to process barcode data obtained with a barcode scanner. The barcode scanner can includes a microprocessor capable of processing barcode data, the barcode data including information, an indication of a function carried out with barcode information, and a security code for use with the barcode information. The barcode scanner can include a barcode scanner device for scanning barcode data and an indication for a function carried out with barcode information, the reader being capable of receiving an indication of a function carried out with the barcode information of the barcode. The reader can also include a security code, the reader capable of sending an indication of a function carried out with barcode information to a host computer.

    "output1": "A system is disclosed for providing an assembled motion segment from searchable quantizations of short motion sequences derived from captured motions. The system includes a database for storing the searchable quantizations, a server for identifying start and end positions of a requested motion and assembling the short motion sequences to produce the requested motion, and a communication device for transmitting the assembled motion segment. The server can also smooth the assembled motion sequences, map them to a target game character, and animate the character. Motion retargeting and variable preferences can be employed in the search process. The system is applicable to various entities capable of movement, such as animals and robots.",
    "output2": "Technologies are generally described for providing full-motion animation-as-a-service. In some examples, short motion-capture segments may be captured from user motion user interface devices and stored in a database. When a full-motion animation is desired, a start pose and a target pose may be provided, and a multiple-path, multiple-iteration search through the database may be used to assemble the full-motion animation. Motion retargeting may be used to further refine the assembled full-motion animation.",

The UAV of claim 1, wherein said at least one image of the target includes an image of an object wore by the target; and wherein the one or more processors are further configured to, individually or collectively, recognize the target from the image of the object.\n\n12. The UAV of claim 11, wherein the object is a collar.\n\n13. The UAV claim 11, wherein the UAV further comprises an attachment mechanism configured to attach, without human aid, to the object of the target when the target is recognized.\n\n14. The UAV of claim 1, wherein the UAV further comprises one or more speakers configured to play a voice to the target when the target is recognized.\n\n15. The UAV claim 14, wherein the voice is transmitted from a user device to the UAV in real-time.\n\n16. The UAV claim 14 wherein the voice is a pre-recording.\n\n17.
